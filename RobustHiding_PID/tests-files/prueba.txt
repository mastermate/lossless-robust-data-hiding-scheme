The name "JPEG" stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, 
the name of the committee that created the JPEG standard and 
also other standards. The group was organized in 1986,[1] 
issuing the first JPEG standard in 1992, which was approved 
in September 1992 as ITU-T Recommendation T.81[2] and in 1994 as 
ISO/IEC 10918-1.
