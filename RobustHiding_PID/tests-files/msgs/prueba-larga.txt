The badnjak also called veseljak (literally "jovial one" in Serbian)
, is a log brought into the house and placed on the fire on the evening of 
Christmas Eve,(I) a central tradition in Serbian Christmas celebrations. 
The tree from which the badnjak is cut, preferably a young and straight 
oak, is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve. The 
felling, preparation, bringing in, and laying on the fire, are surrounded 
by elaborate rituals, with many regional variations. The burning of the 
log is accompanied by prayers that the coming year brings food, happiness, 
love, luck, and riches. The badnjak is treated as a person, to 
whom salutations and sacrifices such as grain, wine, and honey are offered. 
The log burns on throughout Christmas Day, when the first visitor strikes 
it with a poker or a branch to make sparks fly, requesting that the family's 
happiness and prosperity be as abundant as the sparks. As most Serbs today 
live in towns and cities, the badnjak is often represented by a cluster of 
oak twigs with brown leaves attached, with which the home is decorated on 
Christmas Eve. This modern version of badnjak is usually kept in the home 
until the next Eve.

The festive kindling of the log commemorates the fire that—according 
to folk tradition—the shepherds of Bethlehem built in the cave where 
Jesus Christ was born, to warm the Baby Jesus and his mother throughout
 the night. The badnjak may also be seen as a symbol of the cross upon 
 which Christ was crucified, the warmth of its fire symbolizing the 
 salvation which, in the Christian belief, the crucifixion made 
 possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited 
 from the old Slavic religion. They interpret the badnjak as an 
 incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who 
 dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers 
 were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness 
 of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the 
 vitalizing power of the sun in the coming year. Other South 
 Slavic peoples have similar traditions, and the custom that a 
 family brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve
  has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.

The Serbian badnjak tradition was originally a private affair 
conducted within the family, but since the early 20th century 
it has also been celebrated more publicly. Before World War I, 
soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia developed the custom of laying
 a badnjak on a fire in their barracks. In the succeeding Kingdom 
 of Yugoslavia, the military badnjak ceremony was further elaborated 
 and standardized in army service regulations, but the tradition 
 ended on the outbreak of World War II. Since the early 1990s, 
 the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, 
 organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve in which the 
 badnjak plays a central role. Parishioners festively cut the 
 tree to be used as the badnjak and take it to their church, 
 where it is consecrated by a priest before it is ceremonially
  placed on a fire built in the churchyard. The celebration ends 
  with the parishioners gathering around the fire and socializing,
   accompanied by drinks and snacks.
   
In the evening, a man of the family brings their badnjak into the house. 
If there is more than one badnjak, the thickest of them is regarded 
as the main one, and is brought in first. Stepping across the threshold, 
right foot first, the man greets his gathered family with the words 
"Good evening and happy Christmas Eve to you." The woman of the house
 greets him back, saying "May God give you well-being, and may you 
 have good luck", or "Good luck to you, and together with you for 
 many years to come [may we be]", or similar, before throwing grain
  from a sieve at the man and the badnjak he carries. In Montenegro, 
  two women holding lighted candles stand one on either side of the 
  house door during this ceremony.[3][4]

Upon entering the house the man approaches the fireplace, 
called  —the hearth of an  is similar 
to a campfire, in that it has no vertical surround. He lays the 
badnjak down on the fire and moves it a little forward, to summon 
prosperity for the household.[3] Any other logs are brought in by
 other males and laid on the fire parallel or perpendicular to the 
 first.[4] In a family with the tradition of burning the badnjak 
 and , they are laid one across the other; the males then
  kiss the former, and the females the latter.[3] In Bukovica the 
  two thicker logs are placed side by side, and the thinner one 
  (trinity) is placed in parallel on top.[8] In 19th-century 
  Herzegovina, families with large houses would load their logs 
  onto three or four pairs of oxen, which were then led into the 
  house. The logs were unloaded and laid on the fire, and the oxen 
  driven out through the back door.[9]
